# 1st Assignment by Camila and Tarun

##This is the README file for the first assignment due on 7th October 2016.
###We plan to use the R to analyse two datasets. 
###Both internal and external data sets are retrieved from [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/datapublic) repo. One file is dynamically linked to another. 
#
###The first file is on: [Joining The Avengers Is As Deadly As Jumping Off A Four-Story Building](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/avengers)
###The second file in on: [College Students Arenâ€™t The Only Ones Abusing Adderall](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/grad-students.csv)

###We perform basic transformations on data and illustrate data's distribution using descriptive statistics.
