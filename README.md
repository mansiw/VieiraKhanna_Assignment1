# 1st Assignment by Camila and Tarun
#
##This is the README file for the first assignment due on 7th October 2016.
###We plan to use the R to analyse two datasets. 
###Both internal and external data sets are retrieved from [fivethirtyeight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) repo. One file is dynamically linked to another. 
#
###The first file is on: [Analysis of Marriage Trends in the US](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/marriage)
###The second file in on: [World Alcohol Consumption Patterns](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption)

###We perform basic transformations on data and illustrate data's distribution using descriptive statistics.
