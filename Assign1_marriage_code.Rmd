title: "Analysis of Marriage Trends in the US"
output: html
---

This code contains analysis of data on marriage trends.
(Source data: Decennial Census (years 1960 to 2000) and American Community Survey (years 2001-2012), via IPUMS USA.) 

```{r}
library(rio)
marriage <- import('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/marriage/both_sexes.csv')
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r,  echo=FALSE}
plot(marriage$all_2534)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
